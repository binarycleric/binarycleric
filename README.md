## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jon and I'm a Software Engineer at Heroku (part of Salesforce). I work pretty heavily in Ruby, SQL, and AWS but I can make just about any programming language do whatever silly task is asked of me.

Take a look at some of the work I've done over the years.

## Wall of Fame

Here are the results of a lot of optimization work I did while at LivingSocial in 2015 or so. This change resulted in better response times for our users and allowed us to lower our compute footprint for a critical content distribution service.
